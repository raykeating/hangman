*all commands are case sensitive*

To compile: enter these two commands
"javac Client.java"
"javac Server.java"

Then, run the programs in three separate terminals.
First, start the server with the command
"java Server"

Next, launch two clients, each with the command
"java Client"

Once you have two clients running, the game should begin. 
It is possible to play more than one game at a time.
